Growing up I always had an artist eye and took up new media relatively easily. I found realism particularly interesting, as it is recreating a point in time, demonstrating a version of truth. My favorite genres are also adventure mystery, sci-fi media, but only later finding a way to combine these interests through Special Effects Makeup. </span><span class="fs-5 karla pe-md-5 pb-3" data-v-bf9ed11b> I dabbled in several possible career paths, like becoming a Veterinarian and a Forensic scientist. I was lucky enough to have opportunities to shadow at veterinarian clinics where I observed and assisted them in surgeries, house calls and routine check-ups. These experiences, along with the love of animals, made it possible for me to gain the confidence to manage my own pet sitting business where I learned that I loved management, and utilizing skills, like working with others, time management, problem solving, and detailed oriented work. These skill sets are what empowers me to be a reliable and trusted Assistant Director </span><button class="btn purple-btn mt-2 mb-3 py-2" data-v-bf9ed11b> Download Resume <i class="mdi mdi-download" data-v-bf9ed11b></i></button></div></div>',1),l=[r];function c(p,b,m,f,u,h){return i(),s("div",d,l)}const _=e(o,[["render",c],["__scopeId","data-v-bf9ed11b"]]);export{_ as default};
